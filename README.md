# ⚡ Customer Energy Consumption Clustering

This project performs a clustering analysis on customer energy consumption data in order to discover behavior patterns and identify segments based on usage profiles.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to use unsupervised machine learning techniques (such as K-Means) to group customers with similar energy usage behaviors. This can help:

- Understand consumption habits
- Detect anomalous patterns
- Support decisions in energy planning and personalized services

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
